# Stock-Price-Web-app
The project is to create a web application to get the price and stock volume trade data and present a char to show the trends.  I have used the streamlit which is the simplest way to create a web application quickly.

To run this project:
1. install steamlit  using command !pip install streamlit
2. install yfinance using command !pip install yfinance
3.open command prompt and run command "streamlit run Myapp.py"
